Reading solute configuration
Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx insert-molecules uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Read 1 positions from file sysprep/pos.dat

Try 1 success (now 4719 atoms)!

Added 1 molecules (out of 1 requested)
Writing generated configuration to sysprep/sys.pdb

Back Off! I just backed up sysprep/sys.pdb to sysprep/#sys.pdb.7#

Output configuration contains 4719 atoms in 300 residues
