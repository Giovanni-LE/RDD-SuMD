Reading file PDB/3RFM_LIG_NOWATER/05-md/md.tpr, VERSION 2022-plumed_2.8.1 (single precision)
This run will default to '-update gpu' as requested by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable.
Changing nstlist from 20 to 50, rlist from 1.169 to 1.374

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
Using 1 MPI thread
Using 8 OpenMP threads 

starting mdrun 'Protein in water'
300000 steps,    600.0 ps (continuing from step 300000,    600.0 ps).

Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up PDB/3RFM_LIG_NOWATER/05-md/md_nowat.gro to PDB/3RFM_LIG_NOWATER/05-md/#md_nowat.gro.33#

NOTE: 23 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
