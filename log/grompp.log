Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns_type'

NOTE 1 [file mdp_nowater/02-em.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.


NOTE 2 [file mdp_nowater/02-em.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using
  verlet-buffer-tolerance.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

NOTE 3 [file topol.top, line 44603]:
  System has non-zero total charge: 8.000000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.




WARNING 1 [file topol.top, line 44603]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 14154.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 4 [file mdp_nowater/02-em.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.
