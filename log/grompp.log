Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns-type'

NOTE 1 [file mdp_nowater_acorciata/03-nvt.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using
  verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 2 [file mdp_nowater_acorciata/03-nvt.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, consider
  setting nstcomm equal to nstcalcenergy for less overhead

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

NOTE 3 [file topol.top, line 44603]:
  System has non-zero total charge: 8.000000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.




WARNING 1 [file topol.top, line 44603]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.

NOTE 4 [file mdp_nowater_acorciata/03-nvt.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.


NOTE 5 [file mdp_nowater_acorciata/03-nvt.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.



NOTE 6 [file mdp_nowater_acorciata/03-nvt.mdp]:
  COM removal frequency is set to (1).
  Other settings require a global communication frequency of 10.
  Note that this will require additional global communication steps,
  which will reduce performance when using multiple ranks.
  Consider setting nstcomm to a multiple of 10.
