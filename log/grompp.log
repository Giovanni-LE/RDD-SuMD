Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns-type'
Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

NOTE 1 [file topol.top, line 44603]:
  System has non-zero total charge: 8.000000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.



Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 11764.00

NOTE 2 [file mdp_nowater_acorciata/07-md.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.
