Reading file PDB/3RFM_LIG_NOWATER/05-md/md.tpr, VERSION 2022-plumed_2.8.1 (single precision)
This run will default to '-update gpu' as requested by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable.
Can not increase nstlist because verlet-buffer-tolerance is not set or used

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 1 GPU task in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
Using 1 MPI thread
Using 12 OpenMP threads

NOTE: 15 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
